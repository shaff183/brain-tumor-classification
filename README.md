# Zoo Animal Classification
Using Machine Learning to predict zoo animals. 
The dataset we chose to examine was from the [University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and contains information
on 101 different species of zoo animals. There are 16 different attributes, indicated by boolean values, that help determine which of the 7 different classes that these animals may fall under.

### Running the ML Models
In this repo we have stored all of the data and jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the results we observed. To complete this task, start by cloning the repo and follow the steps noted below.
#### Clone this repo
1. Navigate to the [zoo animal classification repo](https://github.com/shaff183/zoo-animal-classification) and select the green "Code" dropdown
2. Copy the SSH Key to your clipboard
3. Open a Gitbash or Terminal from your desired file location and clone the repo using the git clone command, followed by the SSH Key from your clipboard - NOTE: Do not close this terminal

#### Create the ML Models and run the training and testing operations using the Jupyter Notebooks
1. From the Gitbash or Terminal session mentioned in step 3 of Cloning Instructions, run `source activate PythonData` followed by `jupyter notebook` to launch a Jupyter session
2. Open the **".ipynb"** file that corresponds to the model you wish to run and select "Kernel > Restart & Run All" to build, train, and test the model using scikit-learn and pandas.
